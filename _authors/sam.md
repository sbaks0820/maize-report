Sam Blanc is a college student, Diet Coke addict, and a writer in the purest sense, which means she talks about writing a lot more than she actually does it. When she’s not awkwardly describing herself in the third person, you can catch her at home watching Masterchef over a bowl of Instant Noodles (she enjoys the irony) or out with friends seeking external validation that she is, indeed, funny. She’s incredibly hard-working--unfortunately it’s not always directed towards the things she’s supposed to be working on.

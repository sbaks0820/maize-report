Bitten by a radioactive Dan, Jay has not been seen or heard for weeks. The last sighting reported that they were drowning in highly-caffeinated drinks and still sleeping for 14 hours at a time somehow.  Before they became a semi-nocturnal, stress-fueled gremlin, Jay was a political science and history double major trying to find the secret to life without debilitating poverty.

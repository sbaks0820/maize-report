“I used to be on the path to greatness. I was even compared to Gates, Musk, and my only real equivalent, Steve. I called him Stevie 2.0. But now I’m here at The University Of Illinois! Haha...

\*Stevie and I took a five minute break. Blatant wailing and even random loud banging was heard from the Grainger Library men's bathroom.\*

Sorry about that... probably shouldn’t have had extra beans at Qdoba...

Anyways, as a native of Cupertino, California I’m a 4th- generation Asian American born into Silicon Valley. Everyone I know is in the pipeline to the Big Four or some angel invested startup.

My dad, Tiger Zhou, would always say a light-heartedly yet threatening claim that I would, and nothing less, become Head Developer to eventually work alongside Steve Jobs. I even had custom fitted denim diapers and turtlenecks to boot! He taught me calculus at ten and to learn the readings of Shakespeare. Throwback to when I would watch from inside the window while my friends sang Twinkle Twinkle and had recess. Ah, the dream.

Stanford or UCB weren’t even on my mind, I had tunnel vision for the future where I was head dev, duo tandem with my man. We would be called Stevie N’ Stevie, Stevie Squared, Stevie Gang.

But it all changed right before the iPhone 4 press conference. Mama Tiger, her middle name happens to be Tiger as well, yelled for me to come over as I was shredding the Berkeley recruitment letter: ‘Steve Jobs has died at the age of 56 due to pancreatic cancer.’

I stood there in my double denim turtleneck jean suit, awestruck.

Was there any point of life anymore? Jobs was goals. Stevie N Steve. Steve N Stevie. Steve Steve? Who was next in line, Musk? Hahahahaha, MUSK??!!!?? Oh my god, if I wanted to waste my talents with a nobody I might as well skateboard all day. And so, I spiraled downwards to the life of boarding.

There’s this saying me and my boys say when we board in the Bay down Pier 39 and past In n Out: You either Tony the Hawk until you drop, or you let the Hawk control you, and fly away. This was the motto for me and my boys back home. As I skated my depression away, my GPA tanked.

My parents held an intervention for me my winter Senior semester. By that point I couldn’t get into the top UC’s. There was no prestigious EECS degree with my name on it anymore. So they sent me here, to Urbana, Illinois. I still don’t own a single pair of pants, or a winter jacket. I still longboard to class even when the roads are frozen over. In another life I’m the Apple Head Dev, but for now I’m an Electrical and Computing Engineer here, at THE University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign!

I L L...?”

\*Stevie started breaking down and hyperventilating, The Maize Report lost contact soon after.\*

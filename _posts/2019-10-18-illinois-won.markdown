This Sunday, history was made as the notoriously mediocre Illini Football team beat the #6 ranked Wisconsin Badgers in our Homecoming Game. The game was won with a last minute field goal, putting Illinois one point above their competitors.

A hush came over the Illinois crowd who, not having experienced it since the Clinton era, did not know how to react to a favorable football game outcome. One student put down his 10th jagermeister. “This is a football game? I thought it was just a drinking thing.”

After the initial shock, however, the excitement began to set in among players, students, and alumni alike.

“As someone who feels perpetually emasculated by my sad, mediocre life, I’m taking this win is as a personal success for myself,” one alumnus said.

The victory was followed by a host of classic UIUC post-win traditions. This included screaming, excessive alcohol consumption, and, of course, the losing team transforming slowly and painfully into ears of corn to be later consumed at a triumphant, sacrificial feast.

Lovie Smith, the team’s head coach, was in tears of joy after the game’s conclusion. “I don’t know what the hell happened,” Smith said, “but I’m so glad I finally have something to say every time someone asks me why I’m making 5 million dollars a year.”

The Fighting Illini themselves, ecstatic about their success and already thoroughly hammered, were happy to share their winning strategy.

“Oh it was super easy,” said one member of the team. “We just put our uniforms on some squirrels we found in the quad and set them loose on the field. Who better to face a Badger than another fluffy-tailed rodent?”

“The hardest part was talking them into it,” said another. “They were really concerned about the prospect of irreparable head injury. That Will Smith movie Concussion really got to them.”

On campus, the excitement continued well after the game.

“WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO,” one student elegantly articulated.

His friend expanded on his sentiment: “This is the greatest. Now we have a perfect excuse to get even more wasted than they were already going to!”

“It makes me proud to be an Illini,” said sophomore Helen Klien. “It almost makes me want to wear orange. On purpose! And that is not something I say every day.”

Even the administration was excited by the win. Chancellor Robert Jones released an official statement on the matter which read: “Neener, neener, neener.. See mom, I told you it would happen eventually” followed by the blowing of a raspberry which Mr. Jones’s secretary did not know how to transcribe.

School spirit and conviviality were at an all time high as students celebrated the win well into the night. “It’s miracles like these that really bring our school together,” said senior Ryan Doyle, raising his can of Natty Light high before doubling over to vomit on the street. “I-L-L!”

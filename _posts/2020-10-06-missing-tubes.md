Today, after a week-long string of COVID tent robberies, over 200 missing student saliva samples were found in the dorm room of freshman Donna Oswald. 

Student staff at the COVID 19 testing tent became suspicious of Oswald when she began coming to the tent multiple times per-day and lingering ominously under the canopy. 

“She’d just stand there, gripping her tube and looking around all anxious,” said one university employee. “At first I just thought she was having trouble salivating--performance anxiety, ya know? So I tried not to look at her. But then it happened.”

Employee suspicions were confirmed when multiple people corroborated seeing Oswald shout “LOOK, OVER THERE!” and running down the quad with an entire rack of filled test tubes while everyone was distracted. 

When asked how he remembered the event, another witness, Jamal Price, said “You don't forget a crazy girl running around with a gallon of people's spit. Trust me, I tried.”

With help from witnesses, Campus Police traced the thefts back to Oswald who, the next day, had posted about being potentially COVID positive on her social media. Officers found Oswald in her dorm in Bromley where she was found huddled in the corner of her room, gulping down the vials like shots. 

After prying her hands off of the slimy plastic tubes, they were finally able to get a statement from Oswald. She reportedly swiped the tests in an attempt to contract COVID-19, because, in her own words, “all the cool kids have it.”

Those close to Oswald were surprised by her sudden possible positive status.

“She called me and told me she might have the disease, but I didn’t ask questions. I was just excited that she’d finally made some friends,” said Oswald’s mother when asked for a statement. “But this...this makes a lot more sense.”

When asked to explain herself, Oswald admitted “I just kept hearing all these stories about parties with booze and drugs, and utter disregard for the safety of others and I was like, that’s what college is.”

Oswald’s roommate seemed relatively undisturbed by the whole incident. When asked to comment, she said, “Well maybe she’d be more popular if she didn’t drink other people’s spit.”

After an emergency test, medical professionals determined that while Oswald’s mental stability is questionable, she is still COVID negative, so those who have had contact with her should not be worried. 

“Even infectious diseases don’t want to be around me!” Oswald said, mostly to herself after our reporters left because she made them uncomfortable.

The students whose saliva was either compromised or consumed by Oswald have already been contacted to resubmit samples to the nearest COVID-19 testing tent, and the rest have been properly returned to the Testing Center. The University is working hard to make sure this setback does not make adherence to COVID protocol any more completely and utterly dysfunctional than it already is.

In the words of Clyde Wormsworth, PhD, one of the top scientists on the COVID Control team, “we’re just happy to have our spit back home where it belongs.”

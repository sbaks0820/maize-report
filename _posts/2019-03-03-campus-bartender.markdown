It’s well known and accepted that college campus bartenders are some of the most admirable, important and hard-working people on this Earth. And we at the University of Illinois know that our drink-mixing maestros are some of the greatest. From helping freshman get drunk, to helping professors get drunk, to helping everyone in between get drunk, they do their nuanced and multifaceted work with effortless elegance.

But the true test of bartending brilliance is fast approaching: bigger than homecoming, bigger than dad’s weekend, bigger than the post-final-drowning-your-sorrows rush. This weekend is Unofficial, and everyone on the UIUC bar scene is gearing up for the events.

For Dominick Ralph, a new bartender at Joe’s Brewery, this will be his first Unofficial as an employee of an on-campus drinking establishment.

“I remember my first Unofficial on campus,” said Ralph. “I started before sunrise Friday and didn’t stop ‘till an hour before my 8am the next Monday morning. I threw up so many times, in so many places, on so many people. I just hope I can give that same experience to others, you know?”

For many like Ralph who’ve experienced Unofficial as participants, the prospect of seeing it from the other side of the bar is an exciting one. But for veteran bartender from Legends, Tony Malone, the weekend has other implications.

As Malone sat down to chat, he seemed on edge already. His eyes were bloodshot and twitching, his arms and torso broken out into a dark, blotchy rash. “It’s already started. I can feel it. Get out. Get out while you still can,” he said, foam starting to froth from his mouth like a freshly poured beer.

“Barricade your doors, board your windows, for God’s sake lock up your liquor cabinets. They’re coming!” Malone then proceeded to run from the premises, barreling down Green Street, scratching frantically at his scalp and leaving a trail of dry, flaking skin behind him.

If you see him, please call (555)-439-0003 or inform local authorities.

So while individual bartenders have their own thoughts and opinions on how the weekend will go, the Red Lion has taken a more structured approach to preparation for the upcoming events. Manager Carmin Mane has taken new steps to make sure her staff is fully equipped by calling in Adam “the Big Swig” Samuels, a professional bartending trainer for a group training seminar.

The bar has been transformed into the ultimate bartending training facility and reeks of blood, sweat, and Natty Light. “That’s the smell of imminent success. And spilled beer,” Mane commented.

With the impending weekend, the bartending staff of the Red Lion is going through a strenuous program designed by Samuels himself. This includes running the length of the quad with kegs on their backs, bench pressing drunk freshman, and wiping up copious amounts of vomit under strict time pressure.

“I’m not gonna lie, Mr. “The Swig” is hard on us,” said Lion employee Aman Kaur, “but with his mentorship, my 10-shot pour time has gone down by almost two whole seconds! And I can skewer an olive with a toothpick toss from over 10 feet away!”

Another employee, Jacqueline Daniels was equally enthusiastic about the program. “I’ve heard that “the Swig”’s liver is so strong that he once ingested a pint of pure ethyl alcohol that he thought was vodka and didn’t even notice until he realized that his urine was actually dissolving the porcelain of his toilet. It’s been an honor tending with such an icon.”

Samuels, although too famous and important to sit down to a proper interview with the humble Maize Report, did give us this comment:

“Do I miss it? Yeah. But it’s all about giving back to the kids now. I want the craft to live on. And they all have so much passion for the sport. That’s what matters. They say it’s about how fast you can pop a cork, or high you can pour from without spilling, but really it’s all about how much you love getting other people shit-faced.”

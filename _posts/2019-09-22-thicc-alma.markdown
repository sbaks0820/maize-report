**URBANA-CHAMPAIGN, IL**— On the morning of September 7th, UIUC students began their day like any other Saturday, squinting their hungover eyes at the blinding sunshine, begrudgingly exiting their beds to trudge on over to the nearest establishment serving coffee.

That was until the deafening sounds were reported at approximately 10 AM.

“It was brazy as f\*\*\*. The sun was out and everything, Apple Weather said there wasn’t gonna be thunderstorms, but I could just hear this loud booming. Almost sounded like . . . clapping?” recalls UIUC junior, Joseph Ligma.

Mr. Ligma and other students would soon come to realize that the sounds of clapping was not another bout of schizophrenic Midwestern weather, but the gargantuan cheeks of none other than Alma Mater returning to her iconic spot at the corner of Green and Wright Street, dawning her new curves.

Alma Mater originally stood over UIUC with an outdated look: a fairly rectangular figure with loose fitting academic attire. Now, she struts a form fitting robe to compliment her new hourglass figure, accentuating her thick thighs and busty chest. “Dummy Thicc” is the term being used by most onlookers.

“This was not the first time the beloved Alma Mater underwent restoration, but what makes this current restoration so unique is the absolute scale of the project,” Leonarda Taft, distant relative of the original sculptor Lorado Taft and main visionary for the project, tells Maize Report in an exclusive interview. “We added nearly 7,000 lbs to Alma Mater’s 10,000 lb weight, sculpting the biggest curves possible to reflect today’s modern woman.”

Most students and even faculty are extremely excited for the new change to their beloved university figure.

“I finally feel properly represented on campus. When my freshman 15 quickly turned into the sophomore 45, I felt insecure in my body and completely alienated by the other girls in my sorority. Now that I see Alma confidently showing off her own weight gain, I feel like I can too,” adds Sigma Kappa member Tina Janakowski.

“I cannot wait to calculate the slope of that ass,” says a campus mathematics professor who wishes to remain anonymous.

Others do not embrace the change so welcomingly as their fellow students and staff.

“This is completely disrespectful to the values of the university and the modest reputation we have developed over the years. It is polarizing and straight up political for a public university which should remain neutral,” says Chad, a senior studying criminal justice. Our Maize Report journalist conducting the interview inquired on how thiccie thighs can be considered a political statement, on which Chad declined to comment.

A formal statement from the university has yet to be released regarding the bold restoration.

Regardless of how you may feel about the new restoration, Alma Mater herself has a single message for her haters and fans:

“To thy dummy children of the future, those of the past send thiccie greetings.”

Since this is a developing story, more updates will be added to this article as new information is released.

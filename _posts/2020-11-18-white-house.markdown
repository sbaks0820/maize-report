With at least the rational 50% of the country agreed that this year’s election has now yielded a result, the White House is hard at work preparing for the start of the Biden administration. We asked staffers what they think about the upcoming transition. Here’s what they said:

“He may be leaving the White House, but I have a feeling some of those orange stains he left in these hallowed halls will be with us forever”
*-- White House janitor with a lot of work to do*

“I’m excited to do real work. I was hired for my PhD in History and my Harvard Law degree, and for the last four years my only job has been cooking Trump’s post-snack, pre-dinner cheeseburgers.”
*-- Official White House foreign policy expert/fry cook*

“It’ll be nice to see the dog house in the yard occupied again. I mean, Trump made Pence sleep in there sometimes, but it’s just not the same.”
*-- Pet loving White House staffer*

“It doesn’t quite feel real to me yet. I don’t think it will until we’re allowed to take the parental controls off the TV”
*-- Staffer in charge of getting Trump off the couch and into the bathroom to brush his teeth before bed time*

“This sucks. I’m out of a job”
*-- Animal trainer hired to keep Trump’s attention in briefings by offering him Jellybeans for good behavior*

This weekend, a terrible tragedy occured, the brutal and unprompted stabbing of local man Victor Codgill in his own home by a deranged killer wearing a Scream halloween mask. 

Fortunately for police, the killer was easily apprehended. They do not yet know his identity as he refuses to remove his mask on the grounds of COVID safety. His escape from the scene of the crime was slowed as he insisted on sanitizing every door knob on his escape route out of the house. He was still on the scene when police arrived, bloody knife in one hand, antibacterial wet wipe in the other.

Unfortunately, by the time paramedics arrived, it was too late to save Victor. As the community mourns the loss of one of their own, however, a growing movement is also praising the murderer for his above average consideration of COVID19 safety precautions.

“I don’t judge people for what they do in their personal lives,” said one forward-thinking citizen, “I’m just glad he’s satisfying his homicidal urges in a way that’s safe for the global community.”

“Is it too much to ask for people to not murder other people?” asked another. “Well, obviously yes. But at least we can rest at ease knowing that even psychokillers are willing to listen to the CDC.”

With his dying breaths, even the victim praised his killer for keeping his mouth and nose covered throughout the entirety of the brutal murder.

“He even--used hand sanitizer--between bouts of frenzied--stabbing,” Codgill said in croaking gasps just before flatlining.

In an exclusive interview, the killer issued the following statement: “Did I want to lick the blood straight off his face and take his severed fingers home for my collection? Of course! But right now that’s just not safe.”

Despite the praise for his efforts in the media, he does not see himself as a hero. Just one more psychopath doing his job for the community:

“Homicide is one thing, but the reckless protraction of a global public health crisis? Jesus, I’m not a monster.”

The killer is currently being held in a high security prison where he is awaiting trial. Ongoing investigations have linked him to a slew of other atrocious yet heavily sanitized crimes including the armed robbery of a Lysol factory and a failed kidnapping of NAID Director and America’s Sweetheart, Dr. Anthony Fauci.

After receiving notice of the notorious “Pamvile Pam” aka “Carly Stewart” hanging out next to the bus stop of Transit Plaza, the Maize Report sent out a team for an interview.

Pamville Pam: I really do need to get to Pamville. I actually have a bus to catch in thirty minutes so in return for this interview, can I have some cash?

A photograph and several dollars were exchanged for the interview.

Pamville Pam: I have a really bad rap around Champaign-Urbana. No one ever asks about my story, or my purpose in life. They all just think I’m out to steal their money to help pay for my ‘imaginary family.’ These are plain lies. Why else would a woman in such a crisp, professional brown suit and tie go out during her work-day but to stimulate the many teenagers transitioning into young adulthood? Think of it like a non-religious missionary who stays in the same area for thirty years and occasionally asks for offering at the bus stop...

My purpose is to bring people together. Because of me the local Chambana population has a greater sense of community, and I take pride in that. I know for a fact that the moments I’ve had with others have broadened their horizons. In my free time I like to read the Bible and gain wisdom which I will impart, which is why I’m always near Barnes & Nobles.

Reporter: We heard first-hand from your friend ‘LL Ray,’ or ‘Richard’ that you really go there because and quote: ‘Young mothers give the best money.‘ Is this true?

Pamville Pam: Well LL Ray’s a scam. He’s taking advantage of you, loitering around, feeding you lies, being an overall fake person. Makes me sick. Anyways that’s my story, I’m actually late for Wednesday night communion in Savoy tonight and want to give offering, any way you could spare some extra change?

Reporter: I gave you some money at the beginning remember? Wait, what about your bus to Pamville in thirty minutes?

Pamville Pam: “My wife and kids will starve to death if you don’t give me ten dollars. For Christ’s sake, have you no heart!?”

The local CU police soon arrived on the scene to notify “Pamville Pam” she would be arrested for ‘panhandling’ and ‘loitering’ if she did not vacate the scene. Pamville Pam was seen pushing her way through groups of students, muttering curse words, and asking random people for bus money.

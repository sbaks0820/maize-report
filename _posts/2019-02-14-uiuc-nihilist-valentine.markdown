Valentine’s Day is coming up, and, like anywhere else, students here at UIUC are gearing up to take part in this celebration of romance and love. One such group is the Illi-Nihilists, an RSO dedicated to, according to their website “giving back to an unfeeling and uncaring universe.”

On February 14, they will be having their 4th annual Valentine’s Day poetry reading, Loveapo-lose-a, where their members will share their feelings through the time-honoured art of the written word. According to president and founder Freddie Norton, this long-standing tradition goes all the way back to the club’s humble beginnings.

“When you create a club, there’s a section on the form that asks what you’ll do as an organization. But the RSO office told me that “wallowing in existential dread” wasn’t enough to justify the funding for our bi-monthly karaoke nights. So now we do this too.”

The event will be held on the 14th at 7:30 p.m. by the dumpster outside Papa John’s on Green Street. Admission has been set at 10 dollars for adults, and 7 for students with the presentation of an iCard. All proceeds will go towards helping the conservation efforts surrounding the Yangtze Finless Porpoise. “I really relate to the finless porpoise because it doesn’t have a dorsal fin, but it doesn’t care because it knows that when it comes down to it, our being in this universe is futile and hollow,” said Illi-Nihilist treasurer Christina Ye.

Fellow member Brandon McLaughlin agreed. “Porpoise sounds like purpose. And life has no purpose. But that doesn’t mean that life should have no porpoise. Ya know?”

In order to get people out to the event, Illi-Nihilists have agreed to give the Maize Report a special sneak peek of the kind of performances you can expect to see this Valentine’s Day.

Roses are red
<br />Diamonds are prisms
<br />Valentine’s Day
<br />Is crude capitalism

Roses are red
<br />Crust goes on pie
<br />Chivalry’s dead
<br />And true love is a lie
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Philomena Cortez

Roses are red
<br />A purse has a strap
<br />I thought it was love
<br />And now I have the clap
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Denise Smearboff

Roses are red
<br />Stop signs are red
<br />Blood. red.
<br />Everything. red.
<br />We’re all going to die some day
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Ted. (last name ungiven as “the superficial forename alone reflects the shallow and meaningless state of human existence”)

Club president Norton left us with this: “If you love poetry, charity, and tend towards a general sense of omnipresent pessimism, come out to the Illi-Nihilists’ Loveapo-lose-a this Valentine’s Day. Or don’t. Either way, death is inevitable.”

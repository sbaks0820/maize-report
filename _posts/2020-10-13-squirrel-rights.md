excerpt: "“They are such eager students, perched in the rafters of follenger, just to watch me teach. Just last week, one was so overcome with intellectual curiosity that he launched himself onto the stage to show his appreciation. They are so appreciative. It’s more enthusiasm than I ever get from my human students, certainly more enthusiasm than I ever see from my husband.”"

This past Sunday, radical animal rights group P.I.T.A. (Pain In The Ass) released a statement with their latest objectives. At the top of the list was the acceptance of animals into institutions of higher education.

“We’ve done the math,” said senior PITA executive Ellie Phant. “Squirrels on campus outnumber students 25:1, yet they’re vastly underrepresented in the student body. This is, undoubtedly, a hate crime.”

University of Illinois faculty have also become more aware of the heavy squirrel presence on campus. By and large, they seem to be in favor of this proposition.
	
“They are such eager students, perched in the rafters of follenger, just to watch me teach. Just last week, one was so overcome with intellectual curiosity that he launched himself onto the stage to show his appreciation. They are so appreciative. It’s more enthusiasm than I ever get from my human students, certainly more enthusiasm than I ever see from my husband. Such bright, young, rodent minds,” said professor Arlene Campbell.

“Some people say they won’t be able to handle the academic rigor of university,” said professor Naresh Kamar, “but I have seen squirrels on campus and I have seen my own students and I can tell you there is not much of a difference intellectually.” 

Even Chancellor Robert Jones took a stand against the injustice. And administrators never take a firm stance against anything! “Everyone deserves to go to school and be in debt for it. It’s their God given right as an American.”
	
Students, however, seem to have more mixed opinions about their potential furry classmates. Many students were concerned about the impact this massive change in demographic might have on their own college experiences.
	
Sophomore Billy Hayes said, “it's already hard enough to transfer into CS, man. I can hardly keep up with the Asians. Now I have to compete against the squirrels too? Maybe I should just drop out. It worked for Steve Jobs.”
	
“They’ll never survive their first lab,” said MCB major Michelle Tran. “Most of them don’t even own closed toed shoes. And they’ll never find a lab coat that fits them”
	
Others were concerned not so much about the squirrels academically, but how their presence would affect campus life as a whole. “When they put that gross vegan stuff next to my real Mac & Cheese, I was mad, but I could handle it,” said Junior Joe Fumero, “But if they push my nuggets or pizza or tater tots get pushed aside to make room for some acorn bullshit, fur will fly. I’m not afraid to pull some tails.”
	
But despite some push back, many students are willing to embrace the possibility of a new range of classmates.
	
Freshman Stephanie Beckman said, “I totally wouldn’t mind rooming with a squirrel. I could, like, paint her claws and braid her tail and she can, like, chew up old pictures of my ex boyfriends.”
	
“I’m really open to any roommate,” said fellow freshman Kellie McPhereson, “as long as they don’t snore too loud. And as long as they’re not gay.”
	
Overall, it’s looking promising for prospective furry friends. All that’s left is to get the opinion of the most important group in this decision: the squirrels themselves. When asked about their own feelings towards potential acceptance into the university, the squirrels just started directly at our reporters, an ominous, calculated gleam in their small, beady eyes.

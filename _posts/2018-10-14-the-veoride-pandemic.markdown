Unless you’re new to the UIUC campus, you’ve probably noticed our university’s newest, most environmentally friendly way to get around campus. In fact, you’ve probably been nearly run over by it on a daily basis!

VeoRides are rentable bikes, available all across campus, for students who are running late for class, couldn’t bring their own bikes, or who just want to engage in our university’s culture of exceedingly unsafe biking practices.

However, only days into the school year, the university discovered a problem with their new system.

“When I first saw them, I was so excited. I could sleep for 4.59 more minutes before I have to start off to my 8 AM Calc 3 lecture. I mean, every second counts. And I did the math,” said accounting major Steven Chu, “But then I saw it cost money and I was like ‘shit. I blew it all on Chipotle last week.’”

According to our University of Illinois Statistics Department, on the official Gold-Plated-Toilet-Seat-Owner to Eugene H. Krabs Scale, 98% of University of Illinois students fall on the cartoon crustacean side of things. But VeoRide has come up with a plan that they believe will allow students to use their services much more regularly.

“We’ve found that students are very hesitant to part with their money if it’s not going towards alcohol beverages or a food item stuffed with cheese,” explained VeoRide executive Richard “Dick” Ryder. “But our studies have shown that there is something they are more than willing to part with. Their souls.”

VeoRide’s new bikes, which will be available by spring semester, take both traditional money and payment through a percentage of the human soul with their new SoulSwipe function.

Ryder explained to us here at the Maize Report how it works:

“You just take this little spindle here on the left handlebar and prick your hand. You squeeze a drop of blood into the gear change and chant “Hail Satan. Hail Satan. Let my sinful feet pedal your bike of damnation” three times. It’s as simple as that!”

Out of the 50 students chosen to test this new method, the results so far have been wholly positive.

According to business major Robert Myer, “I was worried that my unshakable moral integrity would crush my Wall Street dreams, but I bike so much I’ll be soulless by second semester. Corporate America, here I come!”

Crop Sciences major Brenda Marshall agreed, though her first impressions were skeptical. “I was a little hesitant to give my immaterial spirit to the embodiment of evil itself, but I don’t see our benevolent Lord doing anything to hinder the environmental holocaust that is global warming. Anyone who’s down to save the trees is alright with me, demon or otherwise.

Even those who have completely given themselves over to the inferno are giving it great reviews. In between bouts of puking black, viscous liquid and writhing around on the floor in unspeakable agony, Biochem major Archie Potts gave the system two thumbs up.

“Without VeoRide’s SoulSwipe, I don’t think I would be able to graduate,” said ECE major Sarah Preston. “I owe my degree and my future as a successful engineer to the Lord of Darkness. This one’s for you, Satan!”
